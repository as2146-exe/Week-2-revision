# The code below sets up a Python list of question items for a quiz.

# Each item is a dictionary, with keys:
# "text"   - stores a statement
# "answer" - stores a character "T" or "F" depending if the statement is True or False
# "guess"  - placeholder for the player guess (either "T" or "F")

# Look at the code provided to take_guess(q_list)
# Run the file and check how this function works.

# (a template for this has already been provided),
#

# This function should loop to take input until a VALID guess is entered
# Any input guess should be converted to UPPER CASE and checked it is valid i.e.
# - right length according to the length of the q_list provided
# - only stores T or F characters.
#
# To test your function edit the second-to-last line in the file
# to call take_valid_guess(q_list) not take_guess(q_list).
